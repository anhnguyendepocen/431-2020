## Announcements

1. Feedback on the [Minute Paper after Class 11](http://bit.ly/431-2020-min11-feedback) is now available.
2. There is a 13-item [Project A Proposal Checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/checklist.html) now available. 
    - Those are the things I've identified to look at in your proposals, so you can pretty much figure out before you submit if your proposal will be accepted.
    - This is also [available on our Shared Google Drive](http://bit.ly/431-2020-proposalA-checklist) if you'd rather see it formatted as a Google Doc.
3. [Details on Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1/quiz1.md) are slowly emerging at that link, and you'll find a lot more there today than was there on Tuesday. Everything you will need to take the Quiz will be linked there at 5 PM on Friday, and you will receive an email from me when the details have been posted.
4. I made some important additions to [Chapter 15 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/dehydration-recovery-in-kids-a-small-study.html), describing the use of `tidy` to make coefficient plots, and the summary statistics described by the `glance` function from the `broom` package. 
    - Please take a look at the two new sections, labeled **15.6** (Coefficient Plots) and **15.9** (Using `glance`...).
5. I had a typo in the [Lab 04 Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/tree/master/labs/lab04) in Question 7, now fixed. The correct response is 465 grams, not 435. Thanks to the student who found this.
6. A Few Important Coding Tips to keep in mind:

7. You might be interested in [the colourpicker gadget](https://deanattali.com/blog/colourpicker-ggmarginal-gadgets/) available in RStudio.
8. The new [preview version of RStudio](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/30/rstudio-v1-4-preview-visual-markdown-editing/) includes visual markdown editing, which is a great feature. I hope to be using it in January.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. The [Project A Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/), due Friday (tomorrow, 2020-10-02) at Noon. Please do not be late.
2. [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1/quiz1.md) will become available to you at 5 PM Friday (tomorrow, 2020-10-02) and is due on Wednesday 2020-10-07 at Noon. Late work is not acceptable.

## What's Next?

On Tuesday, we're going to talk about *p* values and the notion of statistical significance in a more serious way. Don't miss it!

## One Last Thing

- A student asked in the minute paper whether I had any opinions on the debate from Tuesday night.
- Someone else asked why our class is cancelled on Election Day.
