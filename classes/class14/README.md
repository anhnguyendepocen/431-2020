## Announcements

1. Still to come.
    - Quiz 1 results.
2. Why is it important to clearly document your work? From the stat150 project and [Kelly Bodwin](https://twitter.com/kellybodwin), here's some materials on [Reproducibility, Documentation and Communication](https://stat150.blog/post/03-reproducibility/) just in time for your Project A work.
3. Renaming code in scope is possible in RStudio! To see what I'm talking about, see [Elizabeth Eisenhauer's tweet](https://twitter.com/LizStats/status/1310979707329040384).
4. Interested in exporting editable ggplot graphics to Powerpoint? [Shannon Pileggi shows you how](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-09-22-exporting-editable-ggplot-graphics-to-powerpoint-with-officer-and-purrr/).
5. We have cancelled the TA office hours formerly held from 10:30 AM to Noon on Thursday mornings, effective this week. 
6. Saturday 2020-10-10 is World Mental Health Day. Here are some things that you can do for the mental health care of yourself and others:
    - If in crisis, ask for help. Check [CWRU's Mental Health Resources page](https://case.edu/wellness/campuswide-resources/mental-health-resources) for phone numbers and links.
    - Join the WHO [Big Event for Mental Health](https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2020/10/10/default-calendar/the-big-event-for-mental-health), a global online advocacy event on mental health.
    - Review the WHO's [Mental well-being: resources for the public](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/mental-well-being-resources-for-the-public)
    - Take a walk. Stretch. Do something that you think will make you happy. Happiness isn't optional.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/) is due 2020-10-20 at Noon.
2. Before Class 15 (2020-10-13), you should have read Spiegelhalter's Introduction and Chapters 1-9.

## One Last Thing

Still to come.
