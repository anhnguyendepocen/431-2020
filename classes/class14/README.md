## Announcements

1. Quiz 1 results are in your email (sent last night.) The [answer sketch is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1/sketch/README.md). 
    - **Questions about the Quiz** should be held until after today's class, and should then be sent via Piazza as private notes.
    - While you are welcome to ask, Dr. Love graded everything, and also thought long and hard about whether and how much partial credit would be awarded for each item. He will only change your grade in the face of a clear error on his part in applying the credit rules described in the sketch, or if you have identified a problem with the item which makes another answer correct.
2. [Project Proposals Update](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/projects/projectA/proposal_notes_2020-10-06.md) is also available.
    - **STILL TO COME**: If you need another revision after today, it will be due at **TIME TO BE SPECIFIED BY DR LOVE**
3. Why is it important to clearly document your work? From the stat150 project and [Kelly Bodwin](https://twitter.com/kellybodwin), here's some materials on [Reproducibility, Documentation and Communication](https://stat150.blog/post/03-reproducibility/) just in time for your Project A work.
4. If you are annoyed [by the default message whenever you run summarize from dplyr](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/05/dplyr-1-0-0-last-minute-additions/#summarise-and-grouping), you can use `options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)` to suppress it.
5. Renaming code in scope is possible in RStudio! To see what I'm talking about, see [Elizabeth Eisenhauer's tweet](https://twitter.com/LizStats/status/1310979707329040384).
6. Interested in exporting editable ggplot graphics to Powerpoint? [Shannon Pileggi shows you how](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-09-22-exporting-editable-ggplot-graphics-to-powerpoint-with-officer-and-purrr/).
7. Saturday 2020-10-10 is World Mental Health Day. Here are some things that you can do for the mental health care of yourself and others:
    - If in crisis, ask for help. Check [CWRU's Mental Health Resources page](https://case.edu/wellness/campuswide-resources/mental-health-resources) for phone numbers and links.
    - Join the WHO [Big Event for Mental Health](https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2020/10/10/default-calendar/the-big-event-for-mental-health), a global online advocacy event on mental health.
    - Review the WHO's [Mental well-being: resources for the public](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/mental-well-being-resources-for-the-public)
    - Take a walk. Stretch. Talk with someone. Do something that you think will make you happy. Happiness isn't optional.

## What Should I Be Working On?
