3. A [detailed outline](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/examples.html) (with all necessary elements for the Analyses sections) of Project A [is now available](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/examples.html).

4. **Want to learn more Github and version control?** Visit the [Github Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/).
5. How do we tell a compelling story through visuals? From the stat150 project and [Kelly Bodwin](https://twitter.com/kellybodwin), you might be interested in [the Visualization section](https://stat150.blog/post/02-visualization/) and the links it provides.
6. Want to work with census microdata in R? The [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) package can help. 
7. I also recommend [sociome](https://github.com/NikKrieger/sociome), a package developed by Nik Krieger, a former student in this class, that helps the user to operationalize social determinants of health data (specifically measures of area deprivation) into their research, and that makes substantial use of the tools in [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html).

## One Last Thing

Today, we'll look at [The Economist's Election Forecast](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/house) starting with the House of Representatives.

Today just before class there was a [Reddit AMA on the statistics behind voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jae0m8/we_are_stat_professors_with_the_american/), featuring Mary Gray from American U and Andrew Gelman from Columbia U. Sorry that I only learned about this as it ended.
