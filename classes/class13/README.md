## Announcements

1. How do we arrive at reasonable conclusions from data? From the stat150 project and [Kelly Bodwin](https://twitter.com/kellybodwin), here's some materials on [Making Arguments from Data](https://stat150.blog/post/01-evidence/) including many great links that may be of interest.
2. Ted Laderas gave an interesting talk at the R/Medicine 2020 virtual conference on [The MD in .rmd: Teaching Clinicians Data Analytics with R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AexI0lZ7J-o) which you can watch on YouTube, if you're interested.
    - Ted has a newsletter called [Ready for R](https://tinyletter.com/ready4r/archive) where he shares lots of useful stuff.
3. The next [Prevention Research Center for Healthy Neighborhoods seminar](http://www.prchn.org/seminar) on 2020-10-14 will feature Rita Horwitz, President and CEO of Better Health Partnership, where I work as Chief Data Scientist. Rita will be presenting on [The Better Health Pathways Community Hub](https://cwru.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_GtO_UX54QESF73sEfjEpgA) and follow that link to register if you are interested.
4. [Scientific Reasoning for Practical Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6mq5Esjzfw) by Andrew Gelman is now available on YouTube, as part of the Philosophy of Data Science series.
5. A reminder that optional materials related to COVID-19 are archived at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/covid19. If you see anything you think I should post there, let me know.
6. We have cancelled the TA office hours formerly held from 10:30 AM to Noon on Thursday mornings, effective this week. 

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1/quiz1.md) due on Wednesday 2020-10-07 at Noon. Late work is not acceptable.
    - Before you finalize your submission, see the [Notes page for Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1/notes.md) to read notes responding to some questions students have asked about the Quiz.

3. Before Class 15 (2020-10-13), you should have read Spiegelhalter's Introduction and Chapters 1-9 (so this is adding in Chapters 5 and 6.)

## One Last Thing

In the slides today, we'll be spending a little time with [this 2015 article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/) by Christie Aschwanden at FiveThirtyEight.

- One of many articles that's worth a look if you have time (!) is [Science isn't Broken](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/) also by Christie Aschwanden at FiveThirtyEight, but we'll get to this more as the semester continues.
