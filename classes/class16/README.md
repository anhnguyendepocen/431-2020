## Today's Slides

- Class 16 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class16/431_class-16-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class16/431_class-16-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Who Will We Meet Today?

- **Lindsay Petrenchik (and her dog), Joe Powell, Katrina Prantzalos, Dipak Upadhyaya, Long Vu** and **Sam Waddell** (37-39 and 51-53 from the Introductory Student Videos in our Shared Google Drive)

## Advice on Developing a Research Question

- A question is expressed so as to elicit information, and **ends with a question mark**. 
- The question must be one that lends itself well to the use of a regression model (you are welcome to adapt any regression modeling strategy connected to the 432 course) to develop an answer.
- You can study anything you like, so long as you steer clear of things that Dr. Love thinks are inappropriate for a course project.

Straightforward questions with a clear link to models we’ve studied or studying are the best option.

Jeff Leek, in his book [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) has some excellent advice on this. In particular, identify a research question that:

- is concrete, (and for which you can find useful data), and that
- solves a real problem, and that
- gives you an opportunity to do something new,
- that you will feel ownership of, and
- that you want to work on.

I’ll add that your research question needs to be reasonable and plausible given the constraints on your time and energy. This is the time to develop something that can work in this setting, not try to boil the ocean. 

In addition to the examples I provided in [my outline for the Project A analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/examples.html), research questions that begin with:

- "How effectively can we predict whether ..."
- "What can a linear model tell us about ..."
- "How strong is the association between ..."

often yield reasonable choices for Project A, not to suggest that those are the only reasonable choices. Try not to use the exact same style of research question in all three Analyses in your Project A. Mix things up a bit. I also strongly recommend you avoid the use of the word "correlate" in a research question. Everything is correlated with everything else, at least a little.

## Announcements

1. Feedback on the most recent [Minute Paper (after Class 15)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/minutepapers/README.md) is available.
2. The Project A instructions now include:
    - a [summary of the proposals](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/prop_summary.html) which includes [some important instructions on Cleaning Your Variables](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/prop_summary.html), and 
    - a [final report checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/check_final.html), containing (about) [40 things you should check in your report before submitting it](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/check_final.html). 
    - I believe I have now given you all of the guidance you'll receive from me, outside of responding to questions on Piazza. 
3. [ASA Board Releases 2020 Census Quality Indicators](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/News/ASA-Board-Releases-2020-Census-Quality-Indicators.aspx)
    - 2020-10-13: The American Statistical Association Board of Directors endorses the recommendations of the [2020 Census Quality Indicators report](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-2020CensusQualityIndicators.pdf), written by a task force of census experts to shed light on the quality, accuracy, and coverage of the 2020 Census counts, and urges prompt action by the federal government.
4. There is a [Symposium on Climate Action and Health](https://theoec.salsalabs.org/occaclimateandhealther2020/index.html) starting this evening and continuing through Friday 2020-10-23 which is free to all who would like to attend.
    - This unique conference will enlighten health professionals and students on climate change’s impacts on human health. The symposium will not only educate participants but inspire motivation and provide the tools to develop solutions to counteract the health effects of climate change. I'll be attending a couple of the sessions.
5. [Build a Trump vs Biden Prediction Model with R From Scratch](https://medium.com/swlh/build-a-trump-vs-biden-prediction-model-with-r-from-scratch-fa66aee9f5c2), should you so desire.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 05](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab05/lab05.md) is due 2020-10-26 at 9 PM.
2. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/) is now due on **2020-10-30** at Noon.
    - Don't forget to [clean your variables](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/prop_summary.html), use the [headings for the Analyses specified in the outline](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/examples.html), and review the [final report checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/check_final.html) in addition to the [final submission instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/final.html).
