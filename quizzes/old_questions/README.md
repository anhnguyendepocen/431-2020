# Five Old Quiz Questions

Dr. Love prepared a document containing five old quiz questions, as well as an answer sketch for those five questions, and some information on results. This is a set of five questions from an old quiz. After the questions, I have provided an answer sketch, and an idea of how well people did on these questions in the old quiz. This is just a convenient sample of old questions, and is **not** meant to be completely representative of what I might ask you this year.

- Here is [the PDF document containing the old questions, answer sketch and results](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/quizzes/old_questions/five-old-quiz-questions.pdf).
- Here is the `[mitral.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/master/quizzes/old_questions/data/mitral.csv)` data set referred to in Questions 2-4 within the PDF document.

I built this just for the benefit of students worried about Quiz 1 who wanted to understand what it might look like. We're not collecting responses on this set of questions, nor is it required that you even look at this document. If you have questions about this after reading the answer sketch at the end of the document, feel free to ask us.

Thank you.
