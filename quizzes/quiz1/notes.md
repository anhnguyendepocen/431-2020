# Notes Dr. Love has written in response to questions about Quiz 1

## Question 8

The plot shown is a stem-and-leaf display. Such a plot appears in the slides in Classes 6-8. The `stem()` function can be used to produce one.

## Question 14

The question reads: `Provide a single line of R code (you may use at most two pipes) to obtain an appropriate numerical summary
of the relationship between the solvent and diagnosis variables in the q14 tibble.`

- You should read "numerical" as meaning "don't build a ggplot"
- You should read "summary" as meaning "something that summarizes the two variables and their relationship".

## Regarding R code

- A "pipe" on this Quiz can be either `%$%` or `%>%`. So you could have one %>% and one %$%, or two of either, in your response, but not more.
