# First, a little pep talk (thanks to Andrew Heiss @andrewheiss)

Remember, **your grade on a quiz says nothing about your value as a person**. 

Quiz grades are highly imperfect measures of what you've actually learned. You've worked hard so far this semester, and you've learned a lot, regardless of what your score might say. Graduate school is hard, and just the fact that you're here in one of the top programs in the country is so impressive!

PLUS we're in the middle of a global pandemic, there's an election in less than a month, and the US President is currently hospitalized. Again, we're all kind of faking it right now. Just try your best.

# Notes Dr. Love wrote responding to questions about Quiz 1

## R-square or R-squared

When referring to R-square or R-squared in Questions 2, 9, 10 and 27 and anywhere else in the Quiz, we are describing the usual R-square sometimes referred to as multiple R-square. We are **not** referring to the adjusted R-square statistic.

## Regarding the pipe.

- A "pipe" on this Quiz can be either `%$%` or `%>%`. So the phrase "you may use at most two pipes" means that you could have one `%>%` and one `%$%`, or two of either, in your response, but not more.

## Response Types

- Questions 13, 17, 18, 24 and 25 each require a numeric response. Your complete response should be a number, rounded to the appropriate number of decimal places as specified in the question. (Questions 13, 17, 24 and 25 require integer responses, while Question 18 requires you to round your response to one decimal place.) Answers with too many (or too few) decimal places will not receive full credit.
- Questions 14 and 15 each require a line of R code. No other question's responses should include R code.
- Questions 20 and 29 each require a sentence in English. No other question's responses should include such a sentence.

## Question 8

The plot shown is a stem-and-leaf display. Such a plot appears in the slides in Classes 6-8. The `stem()` function can be used to produce one.

## Question 12

The mean prediction error is the mean of the prediction errors.

## Question 14

The question reads: `Provide a single line of R code (you may use at most two pipes) to obtain an appropriate numerical summary
of the relationship between the solvent and diagnosis variables in the q14 tibble.`

- You should read "numerical" as meaning "don't build a ggplot"
- You should read "summary" as meaning "something that summarizes the two variables and their relationship".

An acceptable result for Question 14 uses **at most** two pipes. If you feel that your answer requires more than two pipes, you have tried to do too much. Summarizing the data as they are is a smart choice in light of that restriction.

## Questions 14 and 15

At first glance, some people seem to think that Question 14 and Question 15 are the same question. I'll emphasize that the wording of the task for each question (especially the final sentence) is not identical across the two questions, and this should give you a strong clue as to the distinction between the questions.
