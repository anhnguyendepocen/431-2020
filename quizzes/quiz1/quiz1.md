Quiz 1
================

Details on Quiz 1 will appear here.

## Some Early Notes

- Quiz 1 will be made available to you at 5 PM Eastern time on Friday 2020-10-02. It is due at Noon on 2020-10-07.
    - You will definitely need to be able to do some coding in R to complete the Quiz. There are also questions that involve interpreting R output, and some questions where R is not relevant at all.
    - The Quiz is meant to take 4 hours, and I have given you 115 hours to do it. Some people will choose to take much, much longer. I expect most students will take 3-5 hours, and some will take as little as 2 or as many as 8.
    - The Quiz will include between 25 and 30 questions. 
    - The questions are not in any particular order, and range in difficulty from "things I expect everyone to get right" to "things that are deliberately tricky". 
    - I expect no one to get every question right, although someone might, in part because it's easy to misclick in a Google Form, or blow a detail.
    
## What Sources Are You Allowed to use in Taking the Quiz?

This is an open book, open notes quiz. Anything I've given you is fine. All the books and other texts I've suggested to you in the Syllabus, the READMEs or elsewhere are also fine. 

The one thing that is definitely NOT allowed is discussing the Quiz (even just how well it is going for you) with ANYONE other than Dr. Love and the 431 TAs. This means that, for example, you're not allowed to discuss the quiz with other students in the class, even your Project A partner. You're not allowed to post questions to an online forum (other than our Class Piazza as a private post to the instructors - see below) about the Quiz, either.

### Getting Help During the Quiz

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you have exactly two ways of getting help:

- You can ask your question in a **private post on Piazza to the instructors**. (This is the only kind of post you will be able to make on Piazza during the Quiz.)
- You can ask your question via email to **431-help at case dot edu**. 

During the Quiz period (5 PM 2020-10-02 through noon 2020-10-07) we will not answer questions about the Quiz in any way except the two approaches listed above. 
That means we won't answer Quiz questions in that time frame...

- in TA office hours,
- in class or before/after class on Tuesday 2020-10-06,
- via email except through **431-help at case dot edu** 

### When Should I Ask for Help?

We recommend the following process: 

- If you encounter a tough question, skip it, and build up your confidence by tackling other questions.
- When you return to the tough question, spend no more than 10-15 minutes on it.
- If you still don't have it, take a break (not just to do other questions) but an actual break.
- When you return to the question, it may be much clearer to you. If so, great. If not, spend 5-10 minutes on it, at most, and if you are still stuck, ask us for help.

This is not to say that you cannot ask us sooner than this, but you should never, ever spend more than 20 minutes on any question without asking for help. Not that we'll always give you enough help to get to the right answer, but spinning your wheels endlessly is a waste for all concerned.

## Quiz Logistics

You will receive three things:

1. Some data sets, which may or may not be useful to you
2. A PDF containing all of the questions on the Quiz and the available responses for the multiple-choice questions
3. A link to a Google Form Answer Sheet where you will place your answers

Make sure you can download all of the materials you need successfully and that you can open the Google Form before you do anything else. Do this Friday if at all possible, so you have plenty of time to tackle the Quiz.

All of your answers must be submitted through the Google Form by noon on Wednesday 2020-10-07, without exception. The form will close at that time, and no extensions will be made available, so **do not wait until Wednesday to submit**. We will not accept any responses except through the Google Form. 

The Google Form will contain places to provide your responses to each question, and a final affirmation where you'll type in your name to tell us that you followed the rules for the Quiz. You must complete that affirmation and then submit your results. When you submit your results (in the same way you submit a Minute Paper) you will receive an email copy of your submission, with a link that will allow you to edit your results.

As a result, if you want to work on the Quiz for a while and then take a break, we recommend you submit the Google Form, and then re-open it (using the link you will receive after submission in your CWRU email) to "edit" your response by answering the remaining questions. We will use the form as it has been submitted at noon on Wednesday 2020-10-07.

## The Five Key Sources of Material

There are five sources of material I am using to decide what goes into Quiz 1 and what does not. I won't use anything other than those five sources to motivate the questions. Anything in these materials is fair game...

1. Course Notes: Chapters 1-16
2. Slides and Discussions / Lectures from Classes 01-12 (of course you already have heard Classes 01-10 and the Class 11 slides are available now, too.)
3. Project A Proposal instructions and the work you will have done completing the data management there.
4. Jeffrey Leek, The Elements of Data Analytic Style (the entire text)
5. David Spiegelhalter The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data (introduction and chapters 1-3)
    - I also expect you to have read Chapters 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Spiegelhalter, but I've decided not to ask about them on Quiz 1.

Note also that I may not use all of these materials in the Quiz. I don't want it to be too long. 

## Questions?

Ask us in a private post on Piazza, or email 431-help at case dot edu

Good luck!
