Quiz 1
================

## About the Quiz

- Quiz 1 will be made available to you at 5 PM Eastern time on Friday 2020-10-02. It is due at Noon on 2020-10-07.
    - You will definitely need to be able to do some coding in R to complete the Quiz. There are also questions that involve interpreting R output, and some questions where R is not relevant at all.
    - The Quiz is meant to take 4 hours, and I have given you 115 hours to do it. Some people will choose to take much, much longer. I expect most students will take 3-5 hours, and some will take as little as 2 or as many as 8.
    - The Quiz will include between 25 and 30 questions. 
    - The questions are not in any particular order, and range in difficulty from "things I expect everyone to get right" to "things that are deliberately tricky". 
    - I expect no one to get every question right, although someone might, in part because it's easy to misclick in a Google Form, or blow a detail.
    - Your score is based on the number of correct responses, so there's no chance a blank response will be correct, and a guess might be, so you should definitely answer all of the questions.
    - Occasionally, I ask you to provide a single line of code. In all cases, a single line of code can include at most one pipe for these purposes, although you may or may not need the pipe in any particular setting. Moreover, you need not include the library command at any time for any of your code. Assume in all questions that all relevant packages have been loaded in R.
    
## What Sources Are You Allowed to use in Taking the Quiz?

This is an open book, open notes quiz. Anything I've given you is fine. All the books and other texts I've suggested to you in the Syllabus, the READMEs or elsewhere are also fine. You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants and you must do so by sending an email to 431-help at case dot edu or by making a private post to the instructors on Piazza. That way, we can track what's been asked. We will not guarantee that questions received after 9 AM on Wednesday 2020-10-07 will be answered in a timely fashion, but otherwise, we will try to keep up.

### Getting Help During the Quiz

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you have exactly two ways of getting help:

- You can ask your question in a **private post on Piazza to the instructors**. (This is the only kind of post you will be able to make on Piazza during the Quiz.)
- You can ask your question via email to **431-help at case dot edu**. 

During the Quiz period (5 PM 2020-10-02 through noon 2020-10-07) we will not answer questions about the Quiz in any way except the two approaches listed above. 
That means we won't answer Quiz questions in that time frame...

- in TA office hours,
- in class or before/after class on Tuesday 2020-10-06,
- via email except through **431-help at case dot edu** 

Again, you are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants and you must do so by sending an email to 431-help at case dot edu or by making a private post to the instructors on Piazza. That way, we can track what's been asked. We will not guarantee that questions received after 9 AM on Wednesday 2020-10-07 will be answered in a timely fashion, but otherwise, we will try to keep up.


### When Should I Ask for Help?

We recommend the following process: 

- If you encounter a tough question, skip it, and build up your confidence by tackling other questions.
- When you return to the tough question, spend no more than 10-15 minutes on it.
- If you still don't have it, take a break (not just to do other questions) but an actual break.
- When you return to the question, it may be much clearer to you. If so, great. If not, spend 5-10 minutes on it, at most, and if you are still stuck, ask us for help.

This is not to say that you cannot ask us sooner than this, but you should never, ever spend more than 20 minutes on any question without asking for help. Not that we'll always give you enough help to get to the right answer, but spinning your wheels endlessly is a waste for all concerned.

## Quiz Logistics

You will receive three things:

1. Some data sets, which may or may not be useful to you
2. A PDF containing all of the questions on the Quiz and the available responses for the multiple-choice questions
3. A link to a Google Form Answer Sheet where you will place your answers

Make sure you can download all of the materials you need successfully and that you can open the Google Form before you do anything else. Do this Friday if at all possible, so you have plenty of time to tackle the Quiz.

All of your answers must be submitted through the Google Form by noon on Wednesday 2020-10-07, without exception. The form will close at that time, and no extensions will be made available, so **do not wait until Wednesday to submit**. We will not accept any responses except through the Google Form. 

The Google Form will contain places to provide your responses to each question, and a final affirmation where you'll type in your name to tell us that you followed the rules for the Quiz. You must complete that affirmation and then submit your results. When you submit your results (in the same way you submit a Minute Paper) you will receive an email copy of your submission, with a link that will allow you to edit your results.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz and then return later, you can do this by [1] completing the final question (the affirmation) which asks you to type in your full name, and then [2] submitting the quiz. You will then receive a link at your CWRU email which will allow you to return to the quiz as often as you like without losing your progress.

## The Five Key Sources of Material

There are five sources of material I am using to decide what goes into Quiz 1 and what does not. I won't use anything other than those five sources to motivate the questions. Anything in these materials is fair game...

1. Course Notes: Chapters 1-16
2. Slides and Discussions / Lectures from Classes 01-12 (of course you already have heard Classes 01-10 and the Class 11 slides are available now, too.)
3. Project A Proposal instructions and the work you will have done completing the data management there.
4. Jeffrey Leek, The Elements of Data Analytic Style (the entire text)
5. David Spiegelhalter The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data (introduction and chapters 1-3)
    - I also expect you to have read Chapters 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Spiegelhalter, but I've decided not to ask about them on Quiz 1.

Note also that I may not use all of these materials in the Quiz. I don't want it to be too long. 

## Questions?

Ask us in a private post on Piazza, or email 431-help at case dot edu

Good luck!
