Quiz 1
================

# Materials

1. Three data sets are now available online, and Dr. Love will also place them in the Quiz 1 folder on our Shared Google Drive. They are:

- [algae.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/master/quizzes/quiz1/data/algae.csv), 
- [oscar.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/master/quizzes/quiz1/data/oscar.csv) and 
- [tobacco_boys.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/master/quizzes/quiz1/data/tobacco_boys.csv).

2. The PDF of the Quiz will be available by 5 PM, linked here and also posted to the Quiz 1 folder on our Shared Google Drive. 

3. The Google Form Answer Sheet for the Quiz will be found at http://bit.ly/431-2020-quiz1-answer-sheet. You must log into Google via CWRU to access the Answer Sheet and you must complete your submission of this Form no later than 12 NOON on 2020-10-07. No late work will be accepted. When you submit the Google Form, your responses will be emailed to your CWRU email address, along with a link to allow you to edit your work before the deadline. The link to the Google Form Answer Sheet is also posted to the Quiz 1 folder on our Shared Google Drive.

# Instructions {-}

There are 29 questions on this Quiz, plus an affirmation at the end. It is to your advantage to answer all 29 Questions. Your score is based on the number of correct responses, so there's no chance a blank response will be correct, and a guess might be, so you should definitely answer all of the questions.

## The Google Form Answer Sheet

All of your answers should be placed in the Google Form Answer Sheet, located at http://bit.ly/431-2020-quiz1-answer-sheet. All of your answers must be submitted through the Google Form by noon on Wednesday 2020-10-07, without exception, and the form will close at that time, so do not wait until Wednesday to submit. We will not accept any responses except through [the Google Form](http://bit.ly/431-2020-quiz1-answer-sheet).

The Google Form contains places to provide your responses to each question, and a final affirmation where you'll type in your name to tell us that you followed the rules for the Quiz. You must complete that affirmation and then submit your results. When you submit your results (in the same way you submit a Minute Paper) you will receive an email copy of your submission, with a link that will allow you to edit your results.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz and then return later, you can do this by [1] completing the final question (the affirmation) which asks you to type in your full name, and then [2] submitting the quiz. You will then receive a link at your CWRU email which will allow you to return to the quiz as often as you like without losing your progress.

## The Data Sets

Above, I have provided three data sets (called [algae.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/master/quizzes/quiz1/data/algae.csv), [oscar.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/master/quizzes/quiz1/data/oscar.csv) and [tobacco_boys.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/master/quizzes/quiz1/data/tobacco_boys.csv)) that are mentioned in the Quiz. They may be helpful to you.

## Getting Help

This is an open book, open notes quiz. You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website and that we've been reading in the class, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants. You will be required to complete a short affirmation that you have obeyed these rules as part of submitting the Quiz.

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you have exactly two ways of getting help:

1. You can ask your question in a private post on Piazza to the instructors. (This is the only kind of post you will be able to make on Piazza during the Quiz.)
2. You can ask your question via email to **431-help at case dot edu**.

During the Quiz period (5 PM 2020-10-02 through noon 2020-10-07) we will not answer questions about the Quiz except through the two approaches listed above. We promise to respond to all questions received before 9 AM on 2020-10-07 in a timely fashion.

A few cautions:

- Specific questions are more likely to get helpful answers.
- We will not review your code or your English for you.
- We will not tell you if your answer is correct, or if it is complete.
- We will email all students if we find an error in the Quiz that needs fixing.

### When Should I ask for help?

We recommend the following process.

- If you encounter a tough question, skip it, and build up your confidence by tackling other questions.
- When you return to the tough question, spend no more than 10-15 minutes on it.
If you still don't have it, take a break (not just to do other questions) but an actual break.
- When you return to the question, it may be much clearer to you. If so, great. If not, spend 5-10 minutes on it, at most, and if you are still stuck, ask us for help.
- This is not to say that you cannot ask us sooner than this, but you should **never, ever** spend more than 20 minutes on any question without asking for help. 

## Scoring and Timing

All questions are worth either 3 or 4 points, adding to a total of 100 points. The 13 questions which are worth 4 points each (specifically, Questions 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26 and 29) are marked as such in the Quiz. The questions are not in any particular order, and range in difficulty from "things I expect everyone to get right" to "things that are deliberately tricky".

The Quiz is meant to take 4 hours. I expect most students will take 3-5 hours, and some will take as little as 2 or as many as 8. It is not a good idea to spend a long time on any one question. 

## Other Issues

Occasionally, we ask you to provide a single line of code. If not otherwise specified, a single line of code in response can contain at most two pipes, although you may or may not need the pipe in any particular setting. Moreover, you need not include the `library` command at any time for any of your code. Assume in all questions that all relevant packages have been loaded in R.

## The Five Key Sources of Material

There are the five sources of material I used to build Quiz 1. 

1. Course Notes: Chapters 1-16
2. Slides and Discussions / Lectures from Classes 01-12
3. Project A Proposal instructions and the work you will have done completing the data management there.
4. Jeffrey Leek, The Elements of Data Analytic Style (the entire text)
5. David Spiegelhalter The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data (introduction and chapters 1-3)
    - I also expect you to have read Chapters 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Spiegelhalter, but I've decided not to ask about them on Quiz 1.

Note also that I may not use all of these materials in the Quiz. 

## Questions?

Ask us in a private post on Piazza, or email **431-help at case dot edu**.

Good luck!
